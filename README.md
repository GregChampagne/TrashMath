# TrashMath
Math / Simulations of the game Trash

v0.0.1 - 8-12-24
Notes:
Extremely basic version of the game Trash currently, but it can at least solve for a 10 card hand and then end preemptively
This version also assumes no wildcards and that you are playing alone just trying to see how many hands it will take

Changelog:
- Created shuffle_deck function
- Created play_game function
- Created check_hand function

Hours Worked: 2.25
